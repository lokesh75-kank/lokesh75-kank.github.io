### What is Big Data ?
In my own words it is more than a volume of data. It is super power full asset to draw accurate insights, patterns, trends with computational power to bring changes
for betterment human kinds, find a problem and create a sustainable solution for better world.

#Data Set:

"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shibumohapatra/house-price"

## California House Price prediction Data set
Author dataset description : "SHIBU MOHAPATRA" on Kaggle.

"The US Census Bureau has published California Census Data which has 10 types of metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. The dataset also serves as an input for project scoping and tries to specify the functional and nonfunctional r requirements for it."

Problem Objective:
The data set provide aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median house values in California using the provided dataset

The reason why it interests me is, this data set is dealing with real world problem. The housing prices in california is increasing day by day and soon its seems not not going to be affordable for middle income family. 
This data set helps analyse the median household value and pridict the actual house price for all districts in california.
